# RancidWazuh-Integration-and-ScriptAutomation
Here we will first install and set-up Rancid (Tool for monitoring and backing up network device configurations) on our Wazuh Server. We will then use rancid in our Expect/Bash script to retrieve our configs and make back-ups. Then we will automate with crontab.
